# Linked List Project
An implementation of a C++ program for generating the statistics on the expense records of a
group of people. The expense records were provided in the input file and the program reads the input file and stores the valuable information in the records in a LinkedList. As a final step, the program calculates the expected statistics over the LinkedList.

How to compile
In a terminal, call commands:

>cmake CMakeLists.txt

>make

OR

>cmake CMakeLists.txt && make

Make sure the executable is produced.

Then you can test the project with the command:

>./project1 inputFile outputFile
