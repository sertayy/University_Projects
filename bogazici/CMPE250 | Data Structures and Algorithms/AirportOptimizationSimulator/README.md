# Airport Optimization Simulator
In order to make the minimum number of passengers missing their flights, we were given three ideas to implement all possible combinations of them. This project was coded in C++ through an OOP perspective.

How to compile
In a terminal, call commands:

>cmake CMakeLists.txt

>make

OR

>cmake CMakeLists.txt && make

Make sure the executable is produced.

Then you can test the project with the command:

>./project1 inputFile outputFile
