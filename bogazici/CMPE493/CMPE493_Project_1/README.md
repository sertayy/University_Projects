# Edit Distance Computation
In this project I implemented the Levenshtein edit distance and the DamerauLevenshtein edit distance algorithms in python. 
# Notes
- Selected development platform is Windows 8.
- All the packages used in this projects are built-in packages. That's why there is no need for requirements.txt.
- Output file includes the edit distances, the corresponding edit tables and the sequence of operations of each algorithms. 
##  Execution
To run the program, execute the command mentioned belowed inside the project folder.
```
python edit_distance.py <initial_string> <target_string>
```
For example:
```
python edit_distance.py cdabbadc dcbaabcd
```
